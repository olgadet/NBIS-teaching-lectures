### Notes from 2019-09-17
*first course occasion*

- see course survey comments

### My thoughts
- second part of my talk: too long and people would not remember anything! Re-think and include more hands-on, active learning for these concepts 

#### Some comments and questions from the students:
- hands-on was lacking a purpose, maybe this should be a mini-project
- bioinformatics vs. computational biology

#### Ideas
- prepare a website resource Bioinformatics ABC for the PIs
