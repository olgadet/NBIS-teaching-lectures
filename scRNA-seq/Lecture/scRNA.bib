abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has brought the study of the transcriptome to higher resolution and makes it pos-sible for scientists to provide answers with more clarity to the question of " differential expression " . However, most computational methods still stick with the old mentality of viewing differential expression as a simple " up or down " phenomenon. We advocate that we should fully embrace the features of single cell data, which allows us to observe binary (from Off to On) as well as continuous (the amount of expression) regulations. Results: We develop a method, termed SC2P, that first identifies the phase of expression a gene is in, by taking into account of both cell-and gene-specific contexts, in a model-based and data-driven fashion. We then identify two forms of transcription regulation: phase transition, and magnitude tuning. We demonstrate that compared with existing methods, SC2P provides substantial improvement in sensiti-vity without sacrificing the control of false discovery, as well as better robustness. Furthermore, the analysis provides better interpretation of the nature of regulation types in different genes. Availability: SC2P is implemented as an open source R package publicly available at https://github.com/haowulab/SC2P.},

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

In recent years, various tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data have been proposed, many of them with the purpose of performing differentially expression analysis. In this work, we compare four different tools for single-cell RNA-sequencing differential expression, together with two popular methods originally developed for the analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data, but largely applied to single-cell data. We discuss results obtained on two real and one synthetic dataset, along with considerations about the perspectives of single-cell differential expression analysis. In particular, we explore the methods performance in four different scenarios, mimicking different unimodal or bimodal distributions of the data, as characteristic of single-cell transcriptomics. We observed marked differences between the selected methods in terms of precision and recall, the number of detected differentially expressed genes and the overall performance. Globally, the results obtained in our study suggest that is difficult to identify a best performing tool and that efforts are needed to improve the methodologies for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis and gain better accuracy of results.},

Increasing cell numbers, however, generate extremely large datasets, extending processing time and challenging computing resources. Current scRNAseq analysis tools are not designed to analyze datasets larger than thousands of cells and often lack sensitivity to identify marker genes. With bigSCale, we provide an analytical framework being scalable to analyze millions of cells, addressing challenges of future large datasets. To handle the noise and sparsity of scRNAseq data, bigSCale uses large sample sizes to estimate an accurate numerical model of noise. The framework further includes modules for differential expression analysis, cell clustering and marker identification. A directed convolution strategy allows processing of extremely large datasets, while preserving transcript information from individual cells. We evaluated the performance of bigSCale using a biological model of aberrant gene expression in patient derived neuronal progenitor cells and simulated datasets, which underlined its speed and accuracy in differential expression analysis. To test its applicability for large datasets, we applied bigSCale to analyze 1.3 million cells from the mouse developing forebrain. Its directed down-sampling strategy accumulates information from single cells into index cell transcriptomes, thereby defining cellular clusters with improved resolution. Accordingly, index cell clusters identified rare populations, such as Reelin positive Cajal-Retzius neurons, for which we determined a previously not recognized heterogeneity associated to distinct differentiation stages, spatial organization and cellular function. Together, bigSCale presents a perfect solution to address future challenges of large single-cell datasets.},

abstract = {Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data sets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times contain batch effects that may compromise the integration and interpretation of the data. Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells. The decreasing cost of scRNA-seq experiments 1–4 has encouraged the establishment of large-scale projects such as the Human Cell Atlas, which profile the transcriptomes of thousands to millions of cells. For such large studies, logistical constraints inevitably dictate that data be generated separately i.e., at different times and with different operators. Data may also be generated in multiple laboratories using different cell dissociation and handling protocols, library-preparation technologies and/or sequencing platforms. All of these factors result in batch effects 5,6 , in which the expression of genes in one batch dif-fers systematically from that in another batch. Such differences can mask underlying biology or introduce spurious structure in the data; thus, to avoid misleading conclusions, they must be corrected before further analysis. Most existing methods for batch correction are based on linear regression. The limma package provides the removeBatchEffect func-tion 7 , which fits a linear model containing a blocking term for the batch structure to the expression values for each gene. Subsequently, the coefficient for each blocking term is set to zero, and the expres-sion values are computed from the remaining terms and residuals, thus yielding a new expression matrix without batch effects. The ComBat method 8 uses a similar strategy but performs an additional step involving empirical Bayes shrinkage of the blocking coefficient estimates. This procedure stabilizes the estimates in the presence of limited replicates by sharing information across genes. Other meth-ods, such as RUVseq 9 and svaseq 10 , are also frequently used for batch correction, but their focus is primarily on identifying unknown fac-tors of variation, for example, those due to unrecorded experimental differences in cell processing. After these factors are identified, their effects can be regressed out as described previously. Existing batch-correction methods were specifically designed for bulk RNA-seq. Thus, their application to scRNA-seq data is based on the assumption that the composition of the cell population within each batch is identical. Any systematic differences in mean gene expression between batches are attributed to technical differences that can be regressed out. However, in practice, the population composition is usually not identical across batches in scRNA-seq studies. Even if the same cell types are present in each batch, the abundance of each cell type in the data set can change depending upon subtle differences in procedures such as cell culture or tissue extraction, dissociation and sorting. Consequently, the estimated coefficients for the batch blocking factors are not purely technical but contain a nonzero biological component because of differences in composition. Batch correction based on these coefficients would thus yield inaccurate representations of the cellular expression pro-files, and the results might potentially be worse than if no correction were performed. An alternative approach for data merging and comparison in the presence of batch effects uses a set of landmarks from a reference data set to project new data onto the reference 11,12 . The rationale for this approach is that a given cell type in the reference batch will be most similar to cells of its own type in the new batch. Such projection strategies can be applied by using several dimensionality-reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or diffusion maps, or by using force-based methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This strategy depends on the selec-tion of landmark points in high-dimensional space picked from the reference data set, which cover all cell types that might appear in the later batches. However, if the new batches include cell types that fall outside the transcriptional space explored in the reference batch, these cell types will not be projected to an appropriate position in the space defined by the landmarks (Supplementary Note 1).},

@article{Finak2015,
abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics reveals gene expression heterogeneity but suffers from stochastic dropout and characteristic bimodal expression distributions in which expression is either strongly non-zero or non-detectable. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model for such bimodal data that parameterizes both of these features. We argue that the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes expressed in a cell, should be adjusted for as a source of nuisance variation. Our model provides gene set enrichment analysis tailored to single-cell data. It provides insights into how networks of co-expressed genes evolve across an experimental treatment.

@article{Butler2018,
abstract = {Computational single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods have been successfully applied to experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species to discover and define cellular phenotypes. However, identifying subpopulations of cells that are present across multiple data sets remains challenging. Here, we introduce an analytical strategy for integrating scRNA-seq data sets based on common sources of variation, enabling the identification of shared populations across data sets and downstream comparative analysis. We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab. org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution. With recent improvements in cost and throughput 1–3 , and the avail-ability of fully commercialized workflows 4 , high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics has become an accessible and powerful tool for unbi-ased profiling of complex and heterogeneous systems. In concert with novel computational approaches, these data sets can be used for the discovery of cell types and states 5,6 , the reconstruction of developmen-tal trajectories and fate decisions 7,8 , and to spatially model complex tis-sues 9,10 . Indeed, scRNA-seq is poised to transform our understanding of developmental biology and gene regulation 11–14 , and enable system-atic reconstruction of cellular taxonomies across the human body 6,15 , although substantial computational obstacles remain. In particular, integrated analysis of different scRNA-seq data sets, consisting of mul-tiple transcriptomic subpopulations, either to compare heterogeneous tissues across different conditions or to integrate measurements pro-duced by different technologies, remains challenging. Many powerful methods address individual components of this problem. For example, zero-inflated differential expression tests have been tailored to scRNA-seq data to identify changes within a single-cell type 16,17 , and clustering approaches 18–23 can detect proportional shifts across conditions if cell types are conserved. However, comparative analysis for scRNA-seq poses a unique challenge, as it is difficult to distinguish between changes in the proportional composition of cell types in a sample and expression changes within a given cell type, and simultaneous analysis of multiple data sets will confound these two disparate effects. Therefore, new methods are needed that can jointly analyze multiple data sets and facilitate comparative analysis down-stream. Progress toward this goal is essential for translating the oncom-ing wealth of single-cell sequencing data into biological insight. An integrated computational framework for joint learning between data sets would allow for robust and insightful comparisons of heterogene-ous tissues in health and disease, integration of data from diverse tech-nologies, and comparison of single-cell data from different species. Here, we present a novel computational strategy for integrated analysis of scRNA-seq data sets, motivated by techniques in com-puter vision designed for the alignment and integration of imaging data sets 24,25 . We demonstrate that multivariate methods designed for 'manifold alignment' 26,27 can be successfully applied to scRNA-seq data to identify gene–gene correlation patterns that are conserved across data sets and can embed cells in a shared low-dimensional space. We identify and compare 13 aligned peripheral blood mono-nuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations under resting and interferon $\beta$ (IFN-$\beta$)-stimulated conditions, align scRNA-seq data sets of com-plex tissues produced across multiple technologies, and jointly dis-cover shared cell types from droplet-based 'atlases' of human and mouse pancreatic tissue. These analyses pose distinct challenges for alignment, but in each case, we successfully integrate the data sets to obtain deeper biological insight than would be possible from inde-pendent analysis. Our approach can be applied to data sets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of cells, is compatible with diverse profiling technologies, and is implemented as part of Seurat, an open-source R toolkit for single-cell genomics.},

Single cell transcriptomics enables the measurement of transcriptomic information of thousands of single cells in a single experiment.
